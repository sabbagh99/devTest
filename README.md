## Hello I am Ahmad Al-Sabbagh. I have a bachelor degree in alternative energy   from Al-zaytoonah university and recently I got a certificate in advanced software development from ASAC-LTUC.

## I know Madain corp  for a long time (from youtube Ads) and I was wishing to work in this companty and I am a big fan, any way I know that i did this project not as expected becaue I didn't  write javascript code from long time  so i wish that i did well.

## If you have a position for me with java not javascript :( now or in the future in your  lovely  company, please inform me.
